# Colab for Random forest is updated in the drive and have added some explanations in the comments.
# Tasks for today:
# For the Movies Dataset, you can:
#
# Predict how much money a movie will make at the box office based on details like its budget, genre, director, and ratings.
# Sort movies into genres (like Action, Comedy, or Drama) using features such as budget and release year.
# Guess the rating of a movie, either as a specific number or by grouping ratings into categories.
#
# For the Superstore Sales Dataset, you can:
#
# Predict the total sales of an order by looking at details like product category, region, and quantity sold.
# Estimate the profit from a sale using similar features like region, product type, and quantity.
# Divide orders into "high profit" or "low profit" categories based on how much profit they generate.
# Predict if sales in a region or for a product category will be above or below a certain amount.
# Find out which features, such as product category or region, have the biggest impact on sales or profit.
#
# Each task involves cleaning the data, splitting it into training and test sets, training the Random Forest model, and evaluating its performance.
